# Portfolio

## index.html

The index.html is my home and "About me" page where I"ve written a short bio about myself and included a picture of me and my wife. 

## portfolio.html

Next, we have the portfolio.html page where I currently just made it look like the example images and used template images since I didn't know what else to put there. 

## contact.html

Finally, we have the contact.html page which again looks similar to the template images given which includes a Bootstrap form element that I don't think actually does anything but it looks like what it's suppose to look like and I'm happy with it.

## The css

The css I've written is mostly to add some spacing between the elements so the images are up against text or other images. There's also a background image which looks pretty jank especially on smaller screens but I like it.
